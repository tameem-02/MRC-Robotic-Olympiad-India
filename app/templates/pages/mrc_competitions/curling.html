                <li>3. To confirm specifications, the Robot Athlete will be weighed and must fit snugly into a control box.
                    <br>- The control box measures 40 x 40 cm plus two (2) mm tolerance.</li>
                <li>4. The Athlete Robot should be placed in the control box without applying pressure.</li>

                <li>6. The Robot Athlete must have a start and stop button.</li>
                <li>7. <strong>The Robot Athlete should have a mechanism suitable for sliding the "stone" and not "throwing" it.</strong></li>
                <li>8. The Robot Athlete may use tires or springs anywhere on any part of its structure.</li>
                <li>9. The use of pneumatic devices / material or the use of air, gas, turbines and related mechanisms is prohibited.</li>
                <li>10. Regardless of robot category, only one processor, up to 6 motors and up to 4 sensors are allowed.</li>
                <li>11. For robot package categories where the microprocessor ports do not allow more than 4 motors, the use of port expansion components eg Lego Mindstorm multiplexer is allowed.</li>

                <li>1. The initial technical inspection will take place on the day of the Games at a place and time to be determined by the organizers.</li>
                <li>2. During the initial technical check the team will be asked questions on the critical points of the robot program. The team should bring their laptop with the robot program open. If the questions show that the team has no knowledge of the program then the team receives a penalty equal to -20% of the score they will bring to the Sport.</li>
                <li>3. Technical inspection includes inspection of the robot according to the conditions described above. If it does not meet the specifications, it will not be allowed to compete and will be automatically disqualified from the event.</li>
                <li>4. If a team is not in place during the initial scrutineering, this results in the team being automatically disqualified from the match.</li>
                <li>5. Secondary technical control is also carried out before each attempt in the match by the assistant referee.</li>
                <li>6. <strong>During the technical inspection, the dimensions and weight of each "stone" will be checked. If the "stones" do not meet the specifications the team will not compete.</strong></li>

                <li><strong>The white circle in the center of the House is called the Button and has a diameter of 14 cm.</strong></li>
                <li>The 2nd goal / "House" on the starting side (see Robot Base) has the sole purpose of centering the Robot Athletes with the main goal / "House".</li>
                <li>The Hack area is scored zero as if a "stone" is found in it as it is considered out of the arena and collected by the referee.</li>
                <li>The closer the stone is to the Button, the higher the score; the farther away, the lower the score. The scoring is calculated using imaginary extensions of the horizontal lines, which are not visible on the track.</li>
                <li>The Throwing line is marked in bold red color, and the Robot Athlete must not step on it during the throw.</li>
                <li><strong>The Preparation Zone is a designated area next to the competition field where teams can place and prepare their Robot Athlete before each attempt.</strong> Only the designated Robot Technician is allowed inside the zone.</li>
                <li>To test the Robot Athletes before the start of the Games there will be a test round for a specific period of time and according to a schedule that will be announced on the day of the Games.</li>

            <h2>🏆 COMPETITION PROCEDURE</h2>
            
            <h3>⏱️ PREPARATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. The Robot Athlete is placed in the preparation area, its technicians equip it with the "stone" and put the Athlete Robot into standby mode.</li>
                <li>2. One of the Technicians places the Robot Athlete in the Robot Base area at the spot chosen by the team.</li>
                <li>3. The Technician is waiting for the referee's start signal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">🏁 START - PROCESS OF THE RACE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must start immediately after the referee's signal and after its Technician presses the Start-Stop button. If the Robot Athlete does not start within the first 5 seconds after pressing the Start button, then the start is considered invalid and only one restart is given to the team.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete should move to the throwing line where it should release the "stone". The Robot Athlete must not step on the red throwing line during the throw.</li>
                <li>The "stone" must slide all the way to the "house" area in order to receive points.</li>
                <li>If the Robot Athlete slightly crosses the throwing line then the attempt is scored 0 points.</li>
                <li>If the "stone" crosses the blue line / border then it is removed from the game. The referee is responsible for removing it.</li>
                <li><strong>The aim of the Sport is to send his "stone" as close as possible to the "Button" in order to receive points.</strong></li>
            </ul>

        <div class="phases-section">
            <h2>🔁 ROUNDS – ATTEMPTS</h2>
            <h3>🏁 COMPETITION PHASES</h3>
            <p>The competition is conducted in two phases: <strong>Qualifiers</strong> and <strong>Finals</strong>.</p>

                <h4>🎯 QUALIFIERS PHASE</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All registered teams participate individually on the arena.</li>
                    <li>Each team has 3 "stones" at their disposal to make 3 separate attempts.</li>
                    <li>The attempts are conducted in a round cycle: all teams complete their first attempt before proceeding to the second, and so on until the third attempt is completed.</li>
                    <li>For each attempt, the team throws all 3 of its stones, and the score is calculated according to the arena scoring zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Only the highest scoring attempt of the three will count as the team's final Qualifiers score.</strong></li>
                    <li>After all teams have completed their attempts, the ranking is determined according to their best score.</li>

            <div class="phase-card qualification">

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The top 5 teams with the highest scores from the Qualifiers advance to the Finals.</strong></li>
                    <li>In the event of a tie for the 5th position, the previous best score will count for each team.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 5 finalist teams compete together on the same arena.</li>
                    <li>All teams take turns throwing one stone at a time, in rotation. After all teams have completed their first throw, the second throw begins, followed by the third and final throw.</li>
                    <li>The order of play in the Finals follows the order in which the teams qualified from the Qualifiers Phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>During the Finals, teams may attempt to displace an opponent's stone from its position, as this is part of the game's strategy (similar to curling).</strong></li>
                    <li>Each team still has 3 "stones" for the Finals, and the final ranking is determined by the scores after all three throws of all finalist teams are completed.</li>
                    <li>🚫 Stepping on or touching the red Throwing Line during the throw is not allowed; doing so will invalidate that throw.</li>

                    <li>Points are awarded based on the position of each stone relative to the scoring zones of the arena at the end of each phase (Qualifiers or Finals).</li>
                    <li>Only the final positions of the stones after all throws are considered for scoring.</li>

                <li>If the Robot Athlete experiences a technical problem.</li>

                <li>Stepping on or touching the red Throwing Line during the throw is not allowed; doing so will invalidate that throw.</li>
