                <li>The Robot Athlete in the Start position must grab the baton, move forward until it detects the black line, and follow it to the Stop point, where it must release the baton within the blue circle area in front of the other Robot Athlete.
                    <br>➤ The baton must not be handed over to the teammate inside the Stop zone. The Robot Athlete holding the baton is allowed to enter the Stop zone only for alignment purposes (it must exit and leave the baton in the blue circle).</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete in the Stop position must grab the baton and move forward until it detects the black line, and by following it, reach the Finish zone.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must stop inside the Finish zone along with the baton for the attempt to be considered valid.
