                <li>The arena is "closed".</li>
                <li>A "closed arena" is defined as an arena in which the starting point and the finishing point are located on the same side of the arena.</li>
                <li>A line runs through the arena, which may form curves, right angles, etc.</li>
                <li>The line is printed on the arena with black ink (or is marked with black-colored adhesive tape).</li>
                <li>The line has a width of 1.8 cm.</li>
                <li>At the intersection point, the Robot Athlete must follow a straight path.</li>
                <li>It is not allowed to lose the line or to follow the intersection path.</li>
                <li>The minimum distance of the line (axially) from the edge of the boundary of the arena is 25 cm.</li>
                <li>The minimum diameter of a turning curve is 10 cm.</li>
                <li>The starting and finishing point is defined as the point where the time measurement sensor is located.</li>

                <li>The lines at the intersections are perpendicular, at least up to twenty (20) centimeters.</li>
                <li>For testing of the Robot Athletes before the start of the Competition, there will be trial rounds, where the Technicians will have access for a specific time period and according to a schedule that will be announced on the day of the competition.</li>

                <li>If a Robot Athlete exceeds 3 minutes, the referee ends the round with a whistle and the time is recorded as 180 seconds (0 points).</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete (or any part of it) is not allowed to exit the boundaries of the arena.
                    <br>➤ If this happens, the attempt is considered failed.</li>
                <li>The robot is allowed to leave the track for a maximum of 3 seconds during the run (e.g., when making a turn or zigzagging while following the line). However, the robot must continue to follow the line in the correct direction.
                    <br>➤ If the robot completely exits the track or loses its direction, the attempt is invalid.</li>
                <li>If the track is larger than the dimensions described in the previous section, the expected time will be increased.</li>
                <li>The Robot Athlete must, throughout the course, cover the line with its body (with minor exceptions in turns) and follow it using sensors placed in a central position on the robot, reading directly above or exactly next to the line (for the basic category).
                    <br>➤ If, in the Basic category, navigation is not clearly based on line detection in this manner, the attempt is considered invalid and a time of zero (0) is recorded.</li>
                <li>If the Robot Athlete fails to start, the time is recorded as 180 seconds (0).</li>

                <li>If a Technician is not present when it is their turn, they lose their attempt, and the next Technician in line will proceed.
                    <br>➤ The Technician who missed their turn must wait until all other attempts are completed for their turn to come again.</li>
                <li>Before each attempt, the Robot Athlete must pass a secondary technical inspection conducted by the assistant referee.</li>
                <li>The referee records the time of the Robot Athletes for each attempt.</li>

Two tracks will be used in parallel for this purpose. Each Robot Athlete will compete on a separate track.</li>
                <li>➤ In the event of a failure to start by a Robot Athlete, only one restart will be granted by the referee.</li>
