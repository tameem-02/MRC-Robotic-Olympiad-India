                <li>If a Robot Athlete throws the ball outside the track through the side boundaries (right or left), the attempt is considered invalid and is scored with 0.</li>
                <li>If a Robot Athlete does not move in a clockwise (spiral) circular motion, but instead moves in a straight line, the throw is invalid and is scored with 0.
                    <br>➤ The goal of this Sport is to simulate the movement of a real shot put athlete.</li>
                <li>If one of the Robot Athlete's wheels touches the black line surrounding the circle, the attempt is considered invalid and is scored with 0.</li>
                <li>If the ball hits or touch any of the walls (the perimeter frame), the attempt is considered invalid and receives 0 points.</li>
                <li>If, during the throw, the referee determines that the Robot Athlete's arm does not comply with the specifications defined for the event, he have the right to disqualify the Robot Athlete from the Sport.</li>
                <li>The extension of the arm during the throw beyond the black line surrounding the circle is permitted only up to the height of the horizontal black line running along the field.</li>
